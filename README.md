GIMM team project 4

Team Ionic App
Importance:
Many of the web apps and websites developed in industry and the private sector are group efforts (and almost all tech companies operate in scrum or agile groups), accordingly it is vital you learn to communicate and work effectively with other developers, artists/designers, testers, and project managers.  I will ask you to try each of these roles even if it is not your preferred role in a group project so that you have enough empathy, understanding, and experience in this role to work effectively with others that take that role on for group work.  
 
There are four roles, one for each group member (if your group has more or less than four contact me and we’ll work something out where a member or a role doubles up).  These are project lead, digital artist/web designer, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer.  Please note that for the first three team projects you will all be doing a certain amount of coding to get familiar with and practice with html, css, and javascript foundations.  For all projects, you must indicate who has what role and stick with those roles for this project, then switch for the next website project so that everyone gets a chance in every role.  This should be well documented and easy for me to look over and understand who was doing what and what they contributed in the website design doc that you will submit with your group game, and you should indicate who is switching to what role for the next group project in a clear way.
Explanation: 
 
This assignment asks you to make a cross platform app using the ionic framework (this will make it written in typescript - a language very similar to javascript.  Likewise the styling will be done with scss - a styling language similar to css.  It is vital you attend class as much as possible during this last phase of the course as ionic framework development is complicated, and it is likely you will need some guidance from me to understand how it all works.  
 
Part of what will go into your WDD for this assignment is your group’s brainstorm and final vote on what app you will be making a prototype (partial functionality, not full) for this semester.  The brainstorm, feedback, and vote process should be well documented in the WDD. 
 
First, have each group member brainstorm 2 original app or game ideas in your scrum groups and describe them in your WDD.  The descriptions of each app that group members come up with (10 total) must include:
 
1. The main functionality of the app or game and the general structure that supports this functionality.  I require that this app or game be designed to improve the world in some way, either by solving a social problem or helping people in some human capacity, even if that's self-improvement.  Within those constraints you're free to design any kind of app or game you like.  
 
2. The app or game's main competitors in the ios app store and googleplay.  
 
3. What your app or game does that these main competitors doesn't do, or what it does better.  
 
4. The price of your app or game and a justification for that price (include the price of the main competitors apps here).
 
5.  A time frame for creating that app or game including deadlines for the main structural elements.
 
6. The main demographic that this app or game will target.
 
7. How much you would charge a customer if they approached you with your own app or game idea and asked you to develop it given the timeframe you think it will take you.
 
Now have each group member assign 2 pts to their favorite idea that is not their own, and 1 pt to their second favorite idea that is not their own out of all of the group ideas.  Whatever app/game gets the most points is the one you will design, implement, and test in ionic the rest of the semester.  Things to consider in your vote include the relative simplicity/complexity of development, originality of the idea, marketing power, usefulness, demographic appeal, etc.
 
Finally, implement the app you have all decided on using the ionic framework.  The app will likely not have the full functionality that you want by the end of the semester but I will expect minimally a working UI with custom styling, multiple sections of the app you can navigate to that are interesting different from one another, and some portion of the functionality you initially envisioned present.  Indicate what this is in your WDD and include a screencast of testing on a mobile device (not just the simulator in your chrome browser).


Rubrix/Assessment:
Here’s what I’ll look at to determine your grade on this group project (500pts max)
 
A detailed account up of the contributions of all group members in the WBB according to the template here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyvn4u8bsJc4cOVGQuDq5G53lTqmLa8VHecsVkxF83Q/edit?usp=sharing (200pts possible)
A review of who was in your opinion the best (not including yourself) in what role and why you have this opinion.  (25 pts possible)
Screenshots and links for group coordination in github and trello (25pts possible)
Screenshots showing completion of every group member’s freecodecamp exercises and screenshots of all group members comments on other team website posts to blackboard discussion, which each member commenting on different websites for all comments  (25 pts possible) 
Fulfillment of the project requirements outlined in the explanation above, a link to the publicly accessible repo where you coordinate and develop the app, and a brief video (no longer than 3 min) showing the final state of the app that is submitted along with the WDD (200 pts)
